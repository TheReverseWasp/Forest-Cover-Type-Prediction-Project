# Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction-Project

In this project, I propose unsupervised and supervised alternatives to Forest Cover Classification Problem.

## Data 

The data source could be finded in the following [Kaggle Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction). 

## Solutions implemented

I implemented two versions of kmeans (unsupervised) and a Random Forest (supervised).

## Conclusions

The overall results shows that supervised learning is better than unsupervised in terms of performance. In future works, I want to train complex models such as Neural Networks, XGBoost and LightGBM.
